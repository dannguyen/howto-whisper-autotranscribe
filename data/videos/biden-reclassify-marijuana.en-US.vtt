00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.701
The President:
This is monumental.

00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:04.270
Today, my administration
took a major step

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.474
to reclassify marijuana
from a schedule

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.776
one drug to a
schedule three drug.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.544
It's an important move
toward reversing

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.079
longstanding inequities.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.748
Today's announcement
builds on the work

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.616
we've already done to
pardon a record number

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.486
of federal offenses for simple
possession of marijuana,

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.755
and it adds to the action
we've taken the lift barriers

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.858
to housing, employment,
small business loans

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:28.061
and so much more for tens
of thousands of Americans.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.830
Look, folks, no one
should be in jail

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.733
merely for using or
possessing marijuana, period.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.169
Far too many lives
have been upended

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.971
because of a failed
approach to marijuana.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.974
And I'm committed
to righting those wrongs.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.642
You have my word on it.
