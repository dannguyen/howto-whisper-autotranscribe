00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.334
The President:
Thank you very much. Wow.

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.169
We have some big
ones today, huh?

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.172
This is a room
-- loaded up. Wow.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.208
Paula Reid.

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.044
Jonathan Karl.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:11.711
Phil Rucker.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:12.379
Hi, Phil.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.148
How are you?

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:16.182
Kaitlan.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.217
We've got the all-stars.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:19.619
A lot of all-stars today.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.286
You too.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.488
The Press: Alex
Alper, Reuters.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.555
The President: You too.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:23.223
That's good.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:23.890
Well, that's fine.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.760
Thank you very much.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.662
In the past four months,
we've added 10.6 million

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:33.433
jobs, including 643
[thousand] manufacturing

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.370
jobs and 658,000
construction jobs.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.473
It's far beyond
expectations.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:43.743
We've experienced the
smallest contraction of

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.579
any Western nation,
meaning we've been

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.717
affected less than any
other nation -- Western

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.786
nation -- and probably,
almost, I think you can

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:55.021
put us in -- I just saw
some numbers -- I think

00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.557
you can put us into
just about any category

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:58.591
anywhere.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.293
And the fastest
recovery by far.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.394
And that's anywhere.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.196
Nobody has recovered
like we're recovering.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:07.434
If we follow Joe Biden's
strategy, we'd shut down

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:10.804
the entire country after
just having set records on

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.338
growth.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.641
And we also did have
tremendous retail growth,

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.676
as you probably noticed.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.745
We're witnessing the
fastest labor market

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:23.049
recovery from an economic
crisis in our history.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.119
By contrast, the
Obama-Biden administration

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.555
had the slowest, weakest,
and worst recovery in

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:31.124
American history,
as you know.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:33.359
We continue to make
progress in our fight

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.562
against the China virus.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:39.265
New weekly cases have
declined by 44 percent

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.100
since July.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.304
Deaths declined by 20
percent compared to just

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.305
last week.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.173
It's going down
very rapidly.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.108
Really rapidly.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:51.544
This is in contrast to
nations in the European

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.881
Union, which have recently
experienced a sharp

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.082
increase in cases.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.884
They're having a very
big spike over there.

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:01.721
We're hopefully beyond our
spike, and we'll see, but

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.657
we're doing very well
all over our country.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.293
In the past five weeks,
per capita cases doubled

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:11.731
in France; surged to over
300 percent in Spain,

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:15.435
which I've been hearing
about and speaking to some

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.837
of the leaders of Spain,
and they are having a hard

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:22.108
time; and increased more
than 400 percent in Italy

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:23.943
again.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.480
And as you remember, I
stopped -- I put a ban on

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.183
people coming in from
Europe after the ban I

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:34.254
imposed on China, Wuhan
-- but because of Wuhan

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:37.590
primarily, because that
area was very infected.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.395
We -- we also put
a ban on Europe.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:47.567
So Spain is being heavily
impacted, France, and 400

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.202
percent in Italy.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.404
Yesterday, European
nations experienced 50

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:55.842
percent more deaths
than the United States.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.176
And you don't
hear these things.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.511
You don't hear
these statistics.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.914
But the United States
has done really well.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:04.017
Very proud of everybody
that worked on this.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.286
And I really do believe
we're rounding the corner.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.122
And the vaccines are right
there, but even -- not

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.424
even discussing vaccines
and not discussing

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.826
therapeutics, we're
rounding the corner.

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.562
We already have
therapeutics out there, by

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:17.463
the way, which are having
obviously a very big

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:20.934
impact because you look at
that, you look at the --

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.036
the way people are
recovering, it's so much

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.805
better than in the past
before we knew about the

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:29.008
disease and had anything
to fight the disease.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:33.012
On schools, as part of our
science-based approach, we

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:38.117
want schools to safely
open and stay open.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:41.654
Children are at extremely
low risk of complications

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:42.622
from the virus.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:48.394
Less than 0.2 percent
-- 0.2 percent of the

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:51.564
coronavirus deaths have
occurred in those under

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:55.535
the age of 25, and most
had underlying conditions

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.303
where there was a problem.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.772
There is no substitute
for in-person learning.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:02.108
According to a recent
study, student progress in

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:07.480
math decreased by half and
-- using online education

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.784
compared to in-person
or campus education.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:15.622
So, online, we think of so
many things online and how

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.290
great it is; there's
nothing like being in the

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.957
classroom.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:21.594
That's what we've learned
from this whole ordeal.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:24.197
According to the
CDC, school closures

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.066
disproportionately harm
low-income and minority

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:30.303
children, as well as
those with disabilities.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:34.707
And I think you see some
slides behind me that are

00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:38.244
very new, very current.

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:42.181
It's also crucial for
colleges and universities

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:43.449
to stay open.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.319
And we hope that they do
indeed stay open, and we

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.087
want to see Big
10 football.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.188
We hope it's coming back.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:52.959
We have a lot of the
colleges that we're

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.627
talking about, they
want to come back.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.529
We hope that
Michigan agrees.

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.165
We hope that -- and I know
the governor will have a

00:04:59.165 --> 00:04:59.999
lot to say about it.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.701
We hope she approves it.

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:05.104
But we have a couple that
-- Maryland is another

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:05.805
one.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.041
We hope the governor puts
a little pressure on so

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.977
that we can have it, but I
have a feeling they may do

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:11.644
it.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:13.880
They may do it without
having everybody, but I

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.983
think they're going to
have maybe Michigan, maybe

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:17.650
Maryland.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.455
We have a couple of
states that might not

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.457
participate.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:27.093
But people are working
very, very hard to get Big

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:29.662
10 football back,
and I'm pushing it.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:32.365
And it'll be a great thing
for our country and the

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.533
players.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.401
And the coaches want
to do it really badly.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.969
The par- -- the players
are missing -- they only

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.171
have so many
years of this.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.039
And the players are
missing a big opportunity,

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.442
including the chance, in
some of the cases -- they

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.911
have some of the best
players, college players

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.014
in our country, and they
want to get into the NFL

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.716
and they want to make
money in the NFL, and

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:51.250
they're not going to be
able to do that too easy

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.353
if you don't get
to see them play.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.389
It's much safer for
students to live on

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.056
campus.

00:05:57.056 --> 00:06:02.395
And low-risk young people
would, rather than the

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:03.162
alternative.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:06.699
It's -- the alternative is
no good -- than going home

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.968
spreading the virus to
high-risk Americans.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.636
It's -- they want
to be on campus.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:11.838
They want to go
back to school.

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:14.173
And the parents want them
back in school, maybe more

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.442
so than they want to
be back in school.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.344
And they want them back
safely and they want to go

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:20.079
back safely, but
they have to go back.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:23.182
Based on the recent
data from more than 20

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:25.384
colleges, not a single
student who tested

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:28.654
positive for the virus
has been hospitalized.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:30.123
So that's a lot of people.

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:31.290
That's a lot of students.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.726
Not one has been
hospitalized.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:36.295
As we continue to follow
the science-based approach

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:40.066
to protect our people and
vanquish the virus, Joe

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.803
Biden continues to use the
pandemic for political

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:44.470
gain.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.805
Every time I see him, he
starts talking about the

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:46.472
pandemic.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:47.907
He's reading it
off a teleprompter.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.475
I'm not allowed to
use a teleprompter.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.611
Why is that, Phil?

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.312
They ask questions and
he starts reading the

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:54.046
teleprompter.

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.349
He says, "Move the
teleprompter a little bit

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.951
closer, please." I don't
know, I think if I did

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:00.052
that, I'd be
in big trouble.

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:02.755
I think that would be --
that would be the story of

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.290
the year.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.692
When I took early action
in January to ban the

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:11.864
travel and all travel
to and from China, the

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.967
Democrats and Biden, in
particular, called it

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.870
"xenophobic." You
remember that?

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.206
Joe was willing to
sacrifice American lives

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:23.409
to placate the
radical-left open-border

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:24.777
extremists.

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:27.947
And we saved tens of
thousands of lives,

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.016
probably hundreds of
thousands of lives.

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:33.719
And we saved millions of
lives by doing the closing

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:35.521
and now the opening
the way we did it.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.758
Joe's decision to publicly
attack the China ban

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:42.495
proved he lacks the
character or intelligence

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:45.064
or instinct to
do what is right.

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:49.502
Now Biden has launched a
public campaign against

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:52.305
the vaccine, which is so
bad, because we have some

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:55.241
vaccines coming
that are incredible.

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.311
Scott was telling me about
some of the things that

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.012
are happening and it's
very exciting, Scott.

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:01.814
Thank you for being here.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:05.551
But you don't want to have
anything having to do

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:09.021
with, for political
purposes, being an

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.456
anti-vaxxer.

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:13.960
You don't want to be
talking about the vaccines

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.095
in a negative way,
especially when you see

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:19.365
the statistics that
we're starting to see.

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:20.533
They're incredible,
actually.

00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:26.272
Biden is perfectly happy
to endanger the lives of

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:29.175
other people by doing
something that he thinks

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.077
is going to help him
politically because his

00:08:31.077 --> 00:08:32.411
polls are
getting very bad.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.714
They're getting
very shaky.

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:36.782
This was an election that
was going to be very easy,

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.752
very quick, and then the
China virus came in and I

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:41.220
had to go back to
work politically,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.021
unfortunately.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.824
I had to devote more time
politically than to the

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.859
other things we do, which
are very important for our

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:47.526
country.

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:48.494
But I had to go
back to work.

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:52.064
And it looks like -- it
looks like we're going up

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.699
very rapidly.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.103
More rapidly than the
media wants to admit.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.504
And Biden has
had to go out.

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:01.507
He's gotten out of his
basement and he's working.

00:09:01.507 --> 00:09:02.441
Let's see what happens.

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:05.878
But we got to talk about
how great these vaccines

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.079
are if, in fact,
they're great.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:08.414
And I think you're going
to see numbers that are

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:09.849
going to be very,
very impressive.

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:14.854
The approach to the virus
is a very unscientific

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.260
blanket lockdown by the
Democrats -- that's what

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.130
they're talking about --
which takes all of these

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.766
incredible statistics,
records, and it throws

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:27.533
them out the window.

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:30.036
Now, they did say it
would be based on the

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:32.571
recommendation of the
experts, but, you know,

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:36.409
whether expert or not,
we're not doing any more

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.076
shutdowns.

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.345
We did the shutdown and
now we're doing the

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.681
opening, and there won't
be any more shutdowns.

00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:43.649
There could be a little
section, a small section,

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:45.551
where you have a breakout,
but we're not talking

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:49.021
about shutdowns like
they were talking about,

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.122
depending on experts.

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:51.457
We're not going
to be doing that.

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:56.329
The swine flu was a
disaster, you remember,

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:59.298
when -- not nearly as
deadly, not -- not the

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.099
same world.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:04.270
But when Joe Biden was
Vice President, his failed

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:08.240
approach to the swine
flu was disastrous.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.811
He called it -- he called
it N1H1; it's actually

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:12.545
H1N1.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:15.281
You know, you remember the
"H" comes before the "N,"

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:16.916
so it's sort of easy
to remember, right?

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:19.185
But Joe -- Joe always
calls it the opposite way,

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:21.821
but it was -- call it
the "swine flu." It was

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.622
disastrous.

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:26.292
And his own chief of staff
said that when Biden

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:31.464
helped manage the swine
flu in 2009, they, quote,

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:36.135
"did everything possible
wrong." And 60 million

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:40.539
Americans got H1N1 in
that period of time.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:43.109
This is a quote from
his chief of staff.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:48.647
And it's just "purely a
fortuity that this isn't

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:51.584
one of the great mass
casualty events.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:53.986
It had nothing to do with
us doing anything right

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:57.056
because we did everything
wrong." It was a disaster.

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:58.758
It was a disaster.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:01.660
And now he's telling us
how to manage -- he can't

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.829
manage himself.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.098
Two hundred and seventy
thousand Americans were

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:09.869
hospitalized
during this attack.

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:12.104
The outbreak was so
rampant that the Obama

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:15.341
administration told
states to stop testing.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.343
"We don't want any tests,"
because they don't want to

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:19.545
show all of the things
that tests show.

00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:22.114
By the way, we're setting
a record on testing.

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:24.583
Our testing is at a level
that nobody has ever seen

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:25.251
before.

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.853
We're substantially
greater than the second

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:30.656
country -- which is India,
by the way, which has 1.5

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:31.457
billion people.

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:37.930
But we're 50 million tests
ahead -- 50 million ahead.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.168
And they ordered the CDC
to stop counting tests and

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:46.772
stop counting cases, and
then left us a depleted

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:49.408
stockpile, which is
what I inherited.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:52.778
I inherited a depleted
-- a very badly depleted

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:53.479
stockpile.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:56.382
In other words, Biden's
record demonstrates that

00:11:56.382 --> 00:12:00.486
if he had been in charge
of this very serious,

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:05.324
highly, highly contagious
epidemic or pandemic --

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:08.027
the China virus --
countless more Americans

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:09.795
would have died.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:13.165
And if we didn't do what
we did -- and I say it all

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:16.936
the time now because the
media likes to belittle.

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:18.938
What we've done has
been incredible.

00:12:18.938 --> 00:12:20.973
Now you can look at Europe
and you can look at other

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:23.008
places, and you can
start comparing.

00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:26.779
Biden is weak on China.

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:29.882
Yesterday, it was revealed
that a fund -- partly

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:33.285
owned by Joe Biden's son,
Hunter -- facilitated the

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:36.622
sale of a Michigan auto
parts producer to a

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:39.225
leading Chinese military
defense contractor.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:42.261
You don't want to write
about that, do you?

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.597
Biden spent his entire
career selling Michigan

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.332
jobs to China.

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:49.902
Now the Biden family is
selling out our country

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:53.906
directly to the Chinese
military, which has to do

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.975
with this company that
Hunter -- here we go with

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:56.675
Hunter again.

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:58.277
He didn't have a job; now,
all of a sudden, he's

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:02.748
selling companies from
Michigan to China.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:05.284
China's military got
American manufacturing

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:09.021
jobs, and the Biden family
got paid a lot of money.

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:14.894
And I said, "If Joe Biden
ever got elected, China

00:13:14.894 --> 00:13:19.298
will own America." They
will -- they will own

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.100
America.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.203
Finally, I can announce
with great pride that

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:26.972
Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo will be departing

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:30.676
this evening on a historic
trip to Doha -- that's

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:34.613
Qatar -- for the beginning
of intra-Afghan peace

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:35.548
negotiations.

00:13:35.548 --> 00:13:37.349
We've been negotiating
with them for quite some

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:41.921
time, getting along with
them, moved a lot of

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.223
soldiers out.

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:46.325
I got a report this
morning that there's been

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:50.329
nobody killed in
Afghanistan since early

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.063
February.

00:13:51.063 --> 00:13:52.398
It's a long time.

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:55.701
There's been no
deaths, no problems.

00:13:55.701 --> 00:14:00.072
And a lot of progress is
being made in Afghanistan.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:04.310
But we'll be down to 4,000
soldiers in a very short

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.110
period of time.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.480
Likewise, Iraq: We'll
be down to about 2,000

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.283
soldiers in a very
short period of time.

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:13.452
And, in Syria, for the
most part, we're out,

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.720
other than we
kept the oil.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.190
And so we have soldiers
guarding the oil -- not

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.594
too many; I think a small
number -- but they're

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:23.929
guarding the oil.

00:14:23.929 --> 00:14:26.599
And we're helping the
Kurds, and we're making

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:30.069
their lives much more
pleasant because of the

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:32.071
fact that we have the oil.

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:35.574
So we're pretty
much out of Syria.

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:37.943
We're pretty
much out of Iraq.

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:40.980
And we're down to the
smallest force that we've

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.116
had in -- we'll be very
shortly down to that

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:47.186
number in Afghanistan.

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.555
The negotiations are
a result of a bold

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:52.858
diplomatic effort on part
of my administration in

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.093
recent months and years.

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:56.262
The United States will
play an important role in

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:58.631
bringing the parties
together to end the

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:00.633
decades-long war; it's
been going on for almost

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:04.036
20 years, long before I
got involved, I can tell

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:06.071
you that.

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:08.807
And had they not been
wasting our time with all

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:11.944
of the phony witch hunts
and all of the things, we

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:14.446
probably could have
done this even faster.

00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:18.183
But a lot of time had to
be spent wasted like that.

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:20.719
But the parties are
together right now, and

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:24.923
we're negotiating, and
we're really making

00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:26.358
tremendous progress.

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:28.994
Next week at the White
House, we'll be having a

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:32.765
signing between UAE and
Israel, and we could have

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.300
another country
added into that.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.035
And I will tell you,
countries are lining up

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.836
that want to go into it.

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:42.241
As you know, UA- -- UAE
is headed by a very, very

00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:47.079
highly respected gentleman
and respected by

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:47.846
everybody.

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:49.648
And he's a warrior too.

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:51.784
He's a great warrior.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.720
And Mohammed is very
excited about this.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.756
And you'll be hearing
other countries coming in

00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:00.759
over a relatively
short period of time.

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:02.328
And you could have peace
in the Middle East.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:04.196
I think what, ultimately,
will happen is you're

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:07.232
going to have quite a
few countries come in.

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.801
The big ones are
going to be coming in.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:11.337
I spoke to the King of
Saudi Arabia, so we're

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:12.004
talking.

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:14.573
We're starting a -- we
just started the dialogue.

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:16.909
And you'll have
them come in.

00:16:16.909 --> 00:16:21.613
And I think two things are
going to happen: Iran will

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:25.718
-- if we win the election,
Iran will come and sign a

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:29.488
deal with us very, very
rapidly, within the first,

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:31.190
I would say, week, but
let's give ourselves a

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.060
month -- because their
GDP went down 25 percent,

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.930
which is, like, an unheard
of number, and they'd like

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.500
to be able to get back
to having a successful

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.335
country again.

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.536
So I think that'll happen.

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:47.906
And I think, very
importantly, the

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:50.642
Palestinians will get
back into the fold.

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:54.079
And when they see all of
these countries that,

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.415
frankly, have been
supporters of the

00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:59.084
Palestinians -- very big
supporters and, certainly,

00:16:59.084 --> 00:16:59.952
financial supporters.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:03.055
As you know, we used to
pay the Palestinians $750

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:04.423
million a year, and I
ended that some time ago,

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:05.758
on the basis that they
didn't seem to want to

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:08.427
make peace.

00:17:08.427 --> 00:17:13.432
And we'll think about it
once we have a deal, but

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:18.904
I've ended that
quite a while ago.

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:22.708
I'm frankly surprised they
haven't been to the table

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:23.842
earlier.

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.043
But this is the best way.

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:26.378
This is a way that's
going to be great.

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:28.981
This can really bring the
Middle East together.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:32.184
And again, since February,
we haven't had a death in

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:35.387
Afghanistan, which is --
it's a record for many

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:36.321
years.

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:38.157
Not a death.

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:40.325
And we're getting along
very, very well with the

00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:44.196
Taliban and very well
with Afghanistan and its

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:45.397
representatives.

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.732
And we'll see
how it all goes.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:47.800
It's a negotiation.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.236
But Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo will be

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.605
departing in a
little while.

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.274
So I think that's
very exciting news.

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:59.211
And a lot of people
thought that my natural

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:01.780
instinct is war; no,
my natural instinct is

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.248
actually peace.

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:05.484
When we were on the debate
stage, people used to say,

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.920
"Will it be one week or
two weeks before President

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.988
Trump gets into a war?"

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:12.491
But that's not -- I did
rebuild our military.

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:14.493
We have a military that --
two and a half trillion

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:18.897
dollars -- new jets and
rockets and tanks and

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.632
ships and a lot
of things we have.

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:23.836
We have the newest, best
military we've ever had.

00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:27.406
So, hopefully, we
won't have to use it.

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:30.576
Our nuclear program has
been put into gear like

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:34.012
never before, and in
particular, hopefully, we

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:37.783
won't have to use that,
because that's a whole new

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.252
level of destruction.

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:42.454
And we never want to --
just have to pray to God

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:43.655
we never have to use that.

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:44.923
All right, please, Jon.

00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:48.026
The Press: Yes, thank
you, Mr. President.

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:50.395
Why did you lie to
the American people?

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:52.297
And why should we trust
what you have to say now?

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.333
The President: Such a
terrible question and the

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.601
phraseology.

00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:56.735
I didn't lie.

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.904
What I said is: We have
to be calm; we can't be

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:01.106
panicked.

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:03.375
I knew that the
tapes were there.

00:19:03.375 --> 00:19:05.410
These were a series of
phone calls that we had --

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.246
mostly phone calls.

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:11.450
And Bob Woodward is
somebody that I respect,

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.653
just from hearing the name
for many, many years, not

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:17.189
knowing too much about his
work, not caring about his

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:17.856
work.

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:20.359
But I thought it would be
interesting to talk to him

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:23.028
for a period of,
you know, calls.

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:24.563
So we did that.

00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:25.931
I don't know if
it's good or bad.

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:28.233
I don't even know if the
book is good or bad, but,

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:31.770
certainly, if he thought
that was a bad statement,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.339
he would have reported it
because he thinks that --

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:37.175
you know, you don't want
to have anybody that is

00:19:37.175 --> 00:19:41.613
going to suffer medically
because of some fact.

00:19:41.613 --> 00:19:43.582
And he didn't report it
because he didn't think it

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:44.483
was bad.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:45.384
Nobody thought it was bad.

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:46.718
The Press: But when you
told him that this -- The

00:19:46.718 --> 00:19:47.386
President: Wait a minute.

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:48.053
Wait a minute.

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.421
And your question -- the
way you phrased that is

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:50.088
such a disgrace.

00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:51.790
It's a disgrace to ABC
Television Network.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.392
It's a disgrace
to your employer.

00:19:53.392 --> 00:19:54.760
And that's the answer.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.827
Are you ready?

00:19:55.827 --> 00:19:57.162
Because I -- The Press:
Are you saying you didn't

00:19:57.162 --> 00:19:57.829
lie?

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:59.164
The President: I love --
The Press: I mean, you --

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:00.499
you told him that you knew
that -- The President: Of

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:01.166
course I didn't.

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:01.833
Of course I didn't.

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.201
The Press: -- it was
"deadlier than the flu."

00:20:03.201 --> 00:20:03.869
The President: No, no.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:04.536
No, no.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.871
The Press: And then you
went out and told the

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.205
American public that this
was "just like the flu."

00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:08.540
The President: Let me tell
you something: We've had

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.875
flu years -- The Press: I
mean, you told Woodward

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.243
one thing and you told
everybody else something

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:11.910
else.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.578
The President: No.

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:13.245
And five times, right?

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:13.912
Five times.

00:20:13.912 --> 00:20:15.247
You ever hear the
expression, "five times"?

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:16.582
We've had flu years where
we lost 100,000 people.

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:18.650
The flu is a very serious
problem for this country

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.551
also.

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.154
And we've been losing them
-- Scott, what kind of a

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:24.356
number have we lost over
the years with flus?

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:25.624
Into the hundreds
of thousands?

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:28.594
DR. ATLAS: Well, I mean,
the last five years have

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:31.296
been something like 35
to 80 thousand per year,

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:33.365
every year, even with
antiviral drugs and even

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:34.032
with vaccines.

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:35.801
The President: Flu is a
very serious problem also.

00:20:35.801 --> 00:20:37.369
The Press: But you told
Bob Woodward this is --

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:38.971
this is worse than the
most deadly -- "deadlier

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:41.173
than the most strenuous
flu." The President: Okay.

00:20:41.173 --> 00:20:42.507
The Press: And then you
went out and said, "It's

00:20:42.507 --> 00:20:45.310
just like the flu." The
President: What I went out

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.012
and said is very simple --
The Press: And that it was

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:48.347
"going to go away." The
President: Listen, what I

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:51.083
went out and said is very
simple: I want to show a

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:54.586
level of confidence and I
want a show strength as a

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.955
leader, and I want to show
that our country is going

00:20:56.955 --> 00:20:58.890
to be fine, one
way or the other.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.893
Whether we lose one person
-- we shouldn't lose any,

00:21:01.893 --> 00:21:03.228
because this shouldn't
have happened.

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:04.363
This is China's fault.

00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:06.031
This is nobody's
fault but China.

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:08.567
China should not have
allowed it to happen.

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:12.838
Whether you have a -- one
person, 180,000 people, or

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:14.973
two and a half or 3
million people, which it

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:17.042
could have been very
seriously if we didn't

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.243
make the moves.

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:20.045
And when you look at the
opposition, where they

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:22.914
said, "Oh, why did
he put the ban on?"

00:21:22.914 --> 00:21:24.883
-- Doctor Fauci said
we saved hundreds of

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:27.185
thousands of lives by
putting the ban on China

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:29.955
and then, ultimately,
putting the ban on Europe.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.523
There was no lie here.

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:33.725
What we're doing is we're
leading, and we're leading

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:35.093
in a proper way.

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:37.829
And if, frankly, somebody
else was leading it, they

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:39.331
wouldn't have closed it.

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:43.235
If you look at Nancy
Pelosi, you look at Cuomo,

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:47.239
you look at de Blasio,
you look at Biden, months

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:49.341
later, they said there's
no problem -- they're

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:50.676
talking about me.

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:51.910
Months later.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.079
And before any statement
was made -- you have to

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:56.314
remember, I put
the ban on China.

00:21:56.314 --> 00:21:59.851
So, obviously, outwardly I
said it's a very serious

00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:00.886
problem.

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:02.954
And it's always a
serious problem.

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:04.890
That doesn't mean I'm
going to jump up and down

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.525
in the air and start
saying, "People are going

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:07.192
to die!

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:07.859
People are going to die!"

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:08.527
No.

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:09.194
No.

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:10.362
I'm not going to do that.

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.697
We're going to
get through this.

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:13.932
And we're, right now, I
hope -- really think we're

00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:16.001
going to -- we're
rounding the final turn.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.936
And a lot of good things
are happening with

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:20.672
vaccines and with
therapeutics, but there's

00:22:20.672 --> 00:22:21.339
no lying.

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:22.841
And the way you ask
that question is very

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:23.575
disgraceful.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:25.577
The Press: But should
people trust you now?

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:26.945
The President: Phil,
go ahead, please.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:27.612
Go ahead.

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:28.280
Yeah, I do think so.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.081
And I think we
did a great job.

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:29.915
I think we did
a great job.

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:32.150
And the people that did
such -- our generals, our

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:35.854
admirals, Mike Pence, all
of the people that have

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:40.125
worked so hard -- and now
Dr. Atlas -- all of the --

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:44.129
Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx --
they should be respected

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:45.130
for the job they've done.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.132
The Press: So you won't
downplay it again?

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:48.467
The President: And you
haven't -- The Press: You

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:49.134
won't downplay it again?

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:50.469
Because you said
you downplayed it.

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:51.803
That's what you
told (inaudible).

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:53.171
The President: All I'm
doing is -- no, I don't

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:54.506
want to jump up and down
and start screaming

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:55.173
"Death!

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:55.841
Death!"

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:57.175
because that's not
what it's about.

00:22:57.175 --> 00:22:58.276
We have to lead a country.

00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:00.278
We're leading a great
country, and we're doing a

00:23:00.278 --> 00:23:01.213
great job.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.381
And the people that have
done such a good job

00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:05.217
should be given the kind
of credit that they

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:05.884
deserve.

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:08.553
We possibly have done the
best jobs when you start

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:10.355
looking at what we're
doing with the vaccines

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:12.657
and therapeutics
and ventilators.

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:14.459
We had no
ventilators, Jon.

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.695
We make thousands of
ventilators now a month,

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:18.897
and we're supplying them
to the whole world.

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.732
The job we've done
is the best job.

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:25.203
And don't give me any
credit; give the people

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:26.838
that have done
this the credit.

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:27.773
They've done a great job.

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:28.440
Yeah, Phil.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.107
Go ahead.

00:23:29.107 --> 00:23:30.442
The Press: Yeah, Mr.
President, you talked

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:32.611
about the need to stay
calm and not jump up and

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:35.013
down and scare people.

00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.783
A lot of other world
leaders were calm.

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:40.452
German Chancellor Angela
Merkel was very calm and

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:42.754
she presented information
to the German people so

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.456
that they could stay
safe and protect their

00:23:44.456 --> 00:23:45.524
families.

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:47.626
So why as you, as
President of the United

00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:50.228
States, did you not level
with the American people,

00:23:50.228 --> 00:23:52.297
did you not share the
information that you knew

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:53.431
at the time, in real time?

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:55.167
The President: Well, I
don't know what -- what

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:55.834
Angela is doing.

00:23:55.834 --> 00:23:57.669
But if you look at the
European Union right now,

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:59.905
they're having breakouts
like you've never seen

00:23:59.905 --> 00:24:00.772
before.

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:02.707
And, frankly, their
numbers are at a level

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:05.177
that are much worse
than the numbers here.

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:07.012
The Press: Many people
have died in the United

00:24:07.012 --> 00:24:07.679
States.

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.014
The President: We are --
we have done -- we have --

00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:10.348
Phil, we have done much,
much better than the

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:11.016
European Union.

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:13.618
I just read you numbers
that are not good on their

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:15.220
behalf; that are
very good at ours.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.191
And we have rounded the
final turn, and we have --

00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:20.725
we're going to have
vaccines very soon -- The

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:23.195
Press: (Inaudible.) The
President: -- maybe much

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:23.929
sooner than you think.

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:25.263
Listen, maybe much
sooner than you think.

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:26.765
But we have done a
phenomenal job, and the

00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:29.434
people that have done
this job -- including the

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:32.571
American public that's had
to put up with a lot with

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.539
the lockdowns and all of
the things that they had

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:36.741
to do -- they have
to be given credit.

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:38.109
They have to be
given credit.

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:40.345
The Press: But you knew
this was a deadly virus.

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:41.680
The President:
Please, go ahead.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.014
The Press: You knew
it was airborne.

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.349
You knew -- on February
7th, you told Bob Woodward

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:45.684
how it transferred from
person to person in the

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:47.219
air, how deadly it was.

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:49.621
Why did you not come to
the podium and (inaudible)

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:51.523
people what you -- The
President: Well, let me

00:24:51.523 --> 00:24:53.091
ask you this: If Bob
Woodward thought that was

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:54.426
bad -- because this is
stuff that everyone knew.

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:56.962
There's a report that I
have here someplace where

00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:59.865
China said it was
airborne earlier than the

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:00.932
statements I made.

00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:01.933
People knew it
was airborne.

00:25:01.933 --> 00:25:04.236
This was nothing -- this
was no big -- when I say

00:25:04.236 --> 00:25:06.171
it was airborne, everybody
knew it was airborne.

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.172
This was no big thing.

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.907
The Press: (Inaudible)
put that out in February?

00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:10.242
The President: But
read the reports.

00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:12.310
China came out with a
statement that it was an

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.678
airborne disease.

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:15.113
I heard it was an
airborne disease.

00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:16.748
I assumed it early on.

00:25:16.748 --> 00:25:19.284
The fact is, there
has to be a calmness.

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:21.453
You don't want me jumping
up and down, screaming,

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:22.787
"There's going to
be great death.

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:26.291
There is going to..." and
really causing some very,

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:28.960
very serious problems
for the country.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.031
If Bob Woodward thought
what I said was bad, then

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:36.001
he should've immediately,
right after I said it,

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:38.003
gone out to the
authorities so they can

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:39.137
prepare and let them know.

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:40.772
The Press: But Bob
Woodward is not -- The

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:42.841
President: But he didn't
think it was bad, and he

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:44.175
said he didn't
think it was bad.

00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:45.543
He actually said he
didn't think it was bad.

00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:47.145
The Press: Bob Woodward
is not the President.

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:48.480
The President: The only
one that said it was bad

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.814
or thinks it was bad were
the fake news media,

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.683
because they take it and
they try and put it a

00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:52.584
certain way.

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:57.088
If Bob Woodward thought it
was bad, then he should've

00:25:57.088 --> 00:26:00.125
immediately gone out
publicly, not wait four

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:00.825
months.

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:02.160
You know, he's had that
statement for four months,

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:02.928
maybe five months.

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:03.962
He's had it for
a long time.

00:26:03.962 --> 00:26:06.898
It was a series of taped
interviews, mostly by

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:09.367
telephone -- quick
ones, not long ones.

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:10.068
Quick ones.

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:12.804
And it was -- I did it out
of curiosity, because I do

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:15.607
have respect, and I want
to see -- I wonder whether

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:17.876
or not somebody like
that can write good.

00:26:17.876 --> 00:26:19.878
I don't think he can, but
let's see what happens.

00:26:19.878 --> 00:26:20.545
Yeah, please.

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:22.480
The Press: Thank
you, Mr. President.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.382
We're just about 50 days
out from the election and

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:25.884
we haven't seen a
lot out of the Durham

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:26.551
investigation yet.

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:27.252
The President: Yeah.

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:28.453
The Press: Where is that?

00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:30.188
And do you -- do you
have confidence in the

00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:30.855
investigation?

00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:32.624
The President: Well, I
can't tell you that yet.

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:33.291
I have to see.

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:34.225
I'm not involved in it.

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:35.827
I purposely stayed
uninvolved.

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:39.364
I'm, I guess, considered
the chief law enforcement

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:40.565
officer of the country.

00:26:40.565 --> 00:26:42.033
I could be involved
if I wanted to.

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:44.803
I thought it would be
better if I wasn't.

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:48.073
I think it's better if our
great Attorney General

00:26:48.073 --> 00:26:48.740
handle it.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.844
He has Durham, who is a
very, very respected man,

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:54.212
and we're going
to see what it is.

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:55.080
I can't tell you that.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.414
The Press: But do you want
to see more indictments?

00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:57.782
The President: I can tell
you this -- I can tell you

00:26:57.782 --> 00:27:02.754
this: They -- they lied,
they cheated, they leaked,

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:06.224
they got caught.

00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:08.626
They spied on my campaign.

00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:11.696
Never in history has there
been anything like this.

00:27:11.696 --> 00:27:14.532
And I guarantee if the
roles were reversed and I

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:17.202
was on the Democrat side,
people would have been in

00:27:17.202 --> 00:27:19.571
jail at the very
highest level.

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.040
People would have been
in jail for two years

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.575
already.

00:27:23.575 --> 00:27:25.176
Nothing like this
has ever happened.

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:27.612
And the term would be for
many, many years, because

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:30.482
it's treason and other
words can be used also.

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:31.816
The Press: So you think
there should be more

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:33.184
indictments as a part
of this investigation?

00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:34.919
The President: Well, I
think -- just on what I

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:37.188
read in your wonderful
papers, I think -- and --

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:40.525
and see what, you know,
just looking at the media

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:43.128
-- not even what I know.

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:46.598
I think Comey is a
disgrace to our country.

00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:49.467
I think Strzok -- who just
wrote a book, which is a

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:52.103
total fake --
is a disgrace.

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:55.707
I think Page -- Lisa Page,
his lover -- is a disgrace

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:57.842
to our country.

00:27:57.842 --> 00:28:00.545
I think that when you look
at McCabe, where his wife

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:05.183
got $700,000 in campaign
contributions from Hillary

00:28:05.183 --> 00:28:06.618
Clinton -- right?

00:28:06.618 --> 00:28:08.953
And then Hillary Clinton
is under investigation,

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:11.423
and yet she paid the head
of the FBI -- one of the

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:13.491
top people, but actually
the head, because he took

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:16.995
over for -- for the other
guy, who fortunately I

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:17.695
fired.

00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:19.030
I made a good
move when I fired.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.932
That was a smart move --
because they were looking

00:28:20.932 --> 00:28:23.435
to take down this
administration, duly

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:25.236
elected administration.

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:26.438
So I fired him.

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:28.173
That was a great move
when I fired him.

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.774
Because maybe, if I
didn't, I wouldn't be here

00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:31.376
talking to you
as President.

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:35.980
But when McCabe's wife
gets $700,000 in campaign

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.216
contributions when she
was running for whatever

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:41.219
office she was running
from -- from Virginia --

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.254
and yet he's in charge
of the investigation of

00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:43.922
Hillary Clinton.

00:28:43.922 --> 00:28:45.523
Now, he says, "Well, I
wasn't really in charge."

00:28:45.523 --> 00:28:46.958
Of course, he
was in charge.

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:47.926
He was totally in charge.

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:49.928
He knew exactly
what was going on.

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:53.631
These people got caught
in the -- probably the

00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:55.967
biggest political scandal
in the history of our

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:56.835
country.

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.203
They got caught.

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:00.572
Now, what the Durham
report is going to say, I

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.073
can't tell you.

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:05.677
But if they say half as
much as I already know --

00:29:05.677 --> 00:29:06.778
just from seeing it.

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.914
You know, you have people
-- I watch some of the

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:10.582
shows.

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.650
I watch Liz McDonald;
she's fantastic.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.653
I watched Fox Business.

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:19.858
I watched Lou Dobbs last
night, Sean Hannity last

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:22.861
night, Tucker
last night, Laura.

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:26.798
I watched "Fox and
Friends" in the morning.

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:30.468
You watch these shows; you
don't have to go too far

00:29:30.468 --> 00:29:31.503
into the details.

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:34.639
They cover things that are
-- it's really an amazing

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:35.306
thing.

00:29:35.306 --> 00:29:38.843
They got caught in the
biggest political scandal

00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:40.812
in the history
of our country.

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:45.884
They were spying on their
opponent's campaign.

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:48.386
Not only spying; they were
making up fake dossiers.

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:49.854
You have the
dirty dossier.

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:52.490
They were making up the
dirty -- and it was all

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.158
made up.

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:53.825
It was all fiction.

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:55.326
It turned out
to be fiction.

00:29:55.326 --> 00:29:57.996
And then they were using
that in the FISA courts --

00:29:57.996 --> 00:29:59.497
this revered court.

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:02.734
Well, it's not so revered
anymore because when you

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:04.936
look at what they did and
how they played it -- and

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:06.104
they hurt a lot of people.

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:08.606
General Flynn is still
being hurt, and he's being

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:10.041
hurt very badly.

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:11.843
He's a wonderful person.

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:14.979
I spoke to General Milley
about General Flynn two

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:15.713
weeks ago.

00:30:15.713 --> 00:30:17.815
I said, "What do you
think of General Flynn?"

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:19.584
He said, "He's a
great soldier, sir.

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:21.419
He's a wonderful,
wonderful human being."

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:23.054
He's been destroyed.

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:24.455
He's been destroyed.

00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:28.993
No, I think that this --
without knowing anything

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:31.329
about what Durham is going
to release -- the "Durham

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:34.232
report," we'll call it,
or maybe it's going to be

00:30:34.232 --> 00:30:35.667
more than a report.

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:37.435
Maybe it's going to be
much more than a report, I

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:38.102
don't know.

00:30:38.102 --> 00:30:39.771
Maybe it's a report or
maybe it's much more than

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:40.638
that.

00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:43.975
But when I look at the --
the things that everybody

00:30:43.975 --> 00:30:46.244
in this room knows, just
from reading about it from

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:49.948
yourselves back and forth,
I think it's a disgrace to

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:50.982
our country.

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:55.186
And I think if people
don't pay a very, very

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:57.722
substantial price,
it'll happen again.

00:30:57.722 --> 00:31:00.592
And this should never ever 
happen to another President.

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:01.526
Thank you very much.

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:02.760
Thank you, everybody.
