All",12.92
6,64,21.5,SPEAKER_01,0:00:16.7,0:00:41.1," right, let's see what we got here.
I'm taking an immunology course, and I got an A on my last exam.
My immediate thought was, wouldn't Dr.
Fauci be proud of me? Absolutely.
When you get vaccinated, your body makes an immune response that's gonna protect you against the virus.
So maybe this person can go and talk about the immunology of getting vaccinated.
Heck",16.66
7,32,10.1,SPEAKER_00,0:00:41.1,0:00:52.2," yeah, proud of them.
Somebody said, Olivia Rodrigo to the to the vaccine clinic.
Very true.
All of the funny puns, as long as you're getting vaccinated, that's great, whatever it takes.
I",41.06
8,30,11.5,SPEAKER_02,0:00:52.2,0:01:03.9," had a dream that I got the COVID -19 vaccine and met Dr.
Fauci afterwards.
I told him that I bought his bobblehead and he was super cool about it.

11,49,14.4,SPEAKER_00,0:01:06.2,0:01:21.0," Yeah it was amazing.
It was great.
Did anyone else spend their Friday afternoon driving to their second vaccine appointment and crying to Olivia Rodrigo or was that just me? Hey I love that.
I'm so happy that I'm soundtracking your vaccine appointment.
That's great.
That makes me very happy.",66.18
12,40,13.7,SPEAKER_01,0:01:21.0,0:01:34.9," PPL made fun of these Dr.
Fauci prayer candles, but we got my dad one for his birthday in November.
So he lit it every night and everyone in my immediate family was fully vaccinated.
So maybe there's something there.
I",80.96
13,36,9.1,SPEAKER_00,0:01:34.9,0:01:44.3," need like a Fauci candle and the Fauci bobblehead right next to each other.

Get your vaccines.",94.9

And I'm just so excited to go to a concert, aren't you? It goes back to the late 1950s at the Paramount Theater in New York City, which was a Motown concert with The Temptations, The Four Tops.
I'm sorry.
Oh my God.
I'm a really old guy.",104.32

Are",161.52
19,33,10.0,SPEAKER_00,0:02:47.7,0:02:58.0," these chills from my second dose of the vaccine or from listening to Deja Vu by Olivia Rodrigo for the big numberth time today? Oh my gosh.
I hope they're from Deja Vu.
Well,",167.7
20,67,20.8,SPEAKER_01,0:02:58.0,0:03:20.0," that person brings up a good point that I think we should let people know.
When you get vaccinated, if you get particularly the two -dose vaccine, after the second dose, you can sometimes feel fatigued, maybe a little chilly.
That's a good thing, because when your body has that reaction, that means your immune system is revving up and making a really good response against the virus.",178.0
21,9,1.7,SPEAKER_00,0:03:20.1,0:03:21.8," Yeah, I had the same thing after my second shot.",200.08

Got home at 4 a .m.
